    <Message>rofl who the hell are these fools voting woot 
as the best demoman?  At what point did smart 
play and good aim become overlooked in favor of 
random mouse flicking and laying stickies  </Message>

    <Message>everywhere in between constant failed jumps on the enemy medic.  Obviously a better teammate than destro or solid, who actually attempt to do damage rather than just cleanup garbage frags.here is a fun game: download a woot demo or stv of his team and attempt to count the number of shots which are aimed. Place bets with friends in mumble over how many times he will stickyjump into the other team to make up for his lack of dming ability. I know it's tempting to spec sureshot carrying him but take the time to truly observe this demoman and try to decipher what exactly he is attempting to do for his team at any given time. and if you still think he is good go to steam, right click tf2, select delete local content and take up a mw2 gaming career.</Message>
